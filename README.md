# TypeScript Applications

* Run `npm start` for TypeScript execution and REPL (read–eval–print loop).

## Backend with Node/Express (I)
We are going to focus on the most popular applications of TypeScript, like JavaScript, TypeScript is the ideal language for full-stack web development. As it can be used on a server side as well as on a client side. We start with the server-side where we will become familiar with one of the most popular backend options; Node combined with Express.

First, we will see how to setup and start an HTTP Server with Node and Express, which listens for web requests.

Second, we will talk about routs and define a couple of routs to respond to client requests. We will cover the four fundamental routing methods: GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE to retrieve, send, update and delete data.
* GET Request for retrieving data from the Server
* POST Request for sending data to the server
* PATCH Request for updating existing data
* DELETE Request for deleting data
